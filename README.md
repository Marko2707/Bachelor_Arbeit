Optimization of ECG Signal Preprocessing through Peak Detection.

The main file is to be executed to test the first results of models and for the execution of several plots of the ECG Data.
!You have to set the path name in the main.py file to the one where the PTB-XL dataset is. You can find the dataset here: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/

For the execution several dependencies are necessary which include:
Numpy, Pytorch, wfdb, ast, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, and fastai v1

To get fastai v1 I used following pip install: pip install fastai==1.0.61
This was due to the newest version not supporting certain aspects of the models.
